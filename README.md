## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
Install these three tools first:
- **Python 3.10+**: [Download here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) ‚ö†Ô∏è Windows: Check "Add Python to PATH"
- **Node.js 16+**: [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Ollama**: [Download here](https://ollama.ai/) or `brew install ollama` (macOS)

#### ü§ñ Download AI Model (Required - ~20 minutes)
After installing Ollama, you need to download the AI model:

1. **Open Terminal/Command Prompt**
   - **Windows**: Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, press Enter
   - **macOS**: Press `Cmd + Space`, type "terminal", press Enter  
   - **Linux**: Press `Ctrl + Alt + T`

2. **Start Ollama service**:
   ```bash
   ollama serve
   ```
   ‚ö†Ô∏è **Keep this terminal open** - you'll see "Ollama is running" message

3. **Open a new Terminal window** and download the model:
   ```bash
   ollama pull llama3.1:8b
   ```
   ‚è≥ **This takes ~20 minutes** and downloads ~4.7GB. This universal model supports all languages including English and Chinese.

4. **Verify installation**:
   ```bash
   ollama list
   ```
   You should see `llama3.1:8b` in the list.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Keep the first terminal with `ollama serve` running while using Dear Me.

### ‚ö° One-Click Setup

**Choose your operating system:**

#### Windows
1. Double-click `setup.bat`
2. Wait for setup to complete
3. Your app opens at http://localhost:3000

#### macOS/Linux
1. Open Terminal in the project folder
2. Run: `./setup.sh`
3. Your app opens at http://localhost:3000

#### Python (All Platforms)
1. Run: `python setup.py`
2. Your app opens at http://localhost:3000

**That's it!** The script handles everything: downloading AI models, installing dependencies, and starting all services.

### üîÑ Daily Use
After the first setup, just run the same command:
- **Windows**: Double-click `setup.bat`
- **macOS/Linux**: `./setup.sh`  
- **Python**: `python setup.py`

### üé® Get Started

## ü§ñ How It Works

**Dear Me** creates a personalized journaling experience through three simple steps:

1. **Choose Your Mode**: Select guided conversations, casual chat, or free writing
2. **Reflect & Share**: Express your thoughts naturally with your AI companion
3. **Review & Grow**: Access all your entries through the unified calendar interface

The AI adapts to your communication style and remembers important details about your life, creating meaningful conversations that evolve over time.

## üß† Advanced Memory System

**Dear Me** features a sophisticated memory system that creates truly personalized conversations:

### üéØ **Contextual Memory Intelligence**
- **Temporal Awareness**: Distinguishes between current conversations and historical memories
- **Memory Type Classification**: Separates factual information (relationships, personal details) from temporal preferences (interests, goals)
- **Age-Based Relevance**: Automatically applies temporal penalties to outdated information
- **Real-Time Correction**: Instantly updates incorrect memories when corrected by users

### üîç **Smart Memory Retrieval**
- **Pattern Recognition**: Advanced regex and keyword-based memory extraction across 6 categories
- **Relevance Scoring**: Sophisticated algorithms to find the most contextually relevant memories
- **Memory Limits**: Intelligent filtering to prevent information overload (max 5 relevant memories per conversation)
- **Category Organization**: Organized memory storage across personal_info, relationships, interests, challenges, goals, and preferences

### üìä **Memory Insights & Analysis**
- **Evolution Tracking**: Monitors how your thoughts, goals, and preferences change over time
- **Contradiction Detection**: Identifies conflicting information and suggests clarification
- **Pattern Analysis**: Recognizes recurring themes and important life patterns
- **Gap Identification**: Suggests conversation topics based on missing memory categories

This creates conversations that feel natural and personal, as if talking to a friend who truly knows and remembers you.
