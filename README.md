## ⚠️ Important Notes

**Age Recommendation:** At this stage, Dear Me is only recommended for adults. While I've started building age-appropriateness controls, they are still experimental. Please do not use this with children or adolescents.

**Mental Health Disclaimer:** This app is not a replacement for professional mental health care. It is simply a companion to help us unwind, reflect, and capture our feelings in a private space. If you are struggling, please seek support from a qualified psychologist, psychiatrist, or healthcare provider.

- **Node.js 16+**: [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Ollama**: [Download here](https://ollama.ai/) or `brew install ollama` (macOS)

#### 🤖 Download AI Model (Required - ~20 minutes)
After installing Ollama, you need to download the AI model:

1. **Open Terminal/Command Prompt**
   - **Windows**: Press `Win + R`, type `cmd`, press Enter
   - **macOS**: Press `Cmd + Space`, type "terminal", press Enter  
   - **Linux**: Press `Ctrl + Alt + T`

2. **Start Ollama service**:
   ```bash
   ollama serve
   ```
   ⚠️ **Keep this terminal open** - you'll see "Ollama is running" message

3. **Open a new Terminal window** and download the model:
   ```bash
   ollama pull llama3.1:8b
   ```
   ⏳ **This takes ~20 minutes** and downloads ~4.7GB. This universal model supports all languages including English and Chinese.

4. **Verify installation**:
   ```bash
   ollama list
   ```
   You should see `llama3.1:8b` in the list.

⚠️ **Important**: Keep the first terminal with `ollama serve` running while using Dear Me.

## 🤖 How It Works

**Dear Me** creates a personalized journaling experience through three simple steps:

1. **Choose Your Mode**: Select guided conversations, casual chat, or free writing
2. **Reflect & Share**: Express your thoughts naturally with your AI companion
3. **Review & Grow**: Access all your entries through the unified calendar interface

The AI adapts to your communication style and remembers important details about your life, creating meaningful conversations that evolve over time.

## 🧠 Advanced Memory System

**Dear Me** features a sophisticated memory system that creates truly personalized conversations:

### 🎯 **Contextual Memory Intelligence**
- **Temporal Awareness**: Distinguishes between current conversations and historical memories
- **Memory Type Classification**: Separates factual information (relationships, personal details) from temporal preferences (interests, goals)
- **Age-Based Relevance**: Automatically applies temporal penalties to outdated information
- **Real-Time Correction**: Instantly updates incorrect memories when corrected by users

### 🔍 **Smart Memory Retrieval**
- **Pattern Recognition**: Advanced regex and keyword-based memory extraction across 6 categories
- **Relevance Scoring**: Sophisticated algorithms to find the most contextually relevant memories
- **Memory Limits**: Intelligent filtering to prevent information overload (max 5 relevant memories per conversation)
- **Category Organization**: Organized memory storage across personal_info, relationships, interests, challenges, goals, and preferences

### 📊 **Memory Insights & Analysis**
- **Evolution Tracking**: Monitors how your thoughts, goals, and preferences change over time
- **Contradiction Detection**: Identifies conflicting information and suggests clarification
- **Pattern Analysis**: Recognizes recurring themes and important life patterns
- **Gap Identification**: Suggests conversation topics based on missing memory categories

This creates conversations that feel natural and personal, as if talking to a friend who truly knows and remembers you.
